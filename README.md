# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Bike

This case study is part of the Google Data Analytics course.

I will be using the 6-steps of data analysis process for this project: **Ask**, **Prepare**, **Process**, **Analyze**, **Share** and **Act**.


### ****STEP 1: ASK****

#### ****Background****
Cyclistic is a bike-sharing company in Chicago. In 2016, they launched a successful bike-share offering program and have since then grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system at any time. There are 2 types of customers: *casual riders* and *members*. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders; customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

#### ****Business Task****
Analyze the pattern and differences between casual riders and members, to provide insights on converting casual riders into members.

#### ****Business Questions****
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?


### ****STEP 2: PREPARE****

#### ****Data Source and Specification****
The latest 12 months of data are taken from [Divvy Bike website](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). They are stored in CSV files by month.

#### ****Data Credibility****
RELIABLE: The reliability of data is uncertain because the information of riders is removed due to privacy reasons.

ORIGINAL: The data is original as it's owned and collected by Divvy.

COMPREHENSIVE: The data is comprehensive as it contains information about casual riders and members, start and end timestamps of their trips, and start and end stations.

CURRENT: The data is fairly current and up to date as the data is collected from February 2022 to January 2023.

CITED: The data is cited as itâ€™s owned and collected by Divvy.


### ****STEP 3: PROCESS****

#### ****Tools****
Excel and SQL are used for data cleaning and transformation, and Tableau is used for data visualization.
