# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Bike

This case study is part of the Google Data Analytics course.

The latest 12 months of data (February 2022 to January 2023) is taken from here: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

I will be using the 6-steps of data analysis process for this project: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act.

### ****STEP 1: ASK****

#### ****Background****
Cyclistic is a bike-sharing company in Chicago. In 2016, they launched a successful bike-share offering program and has since then grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. There are 2 types of customers: *casual rider* and *members*. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders; customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

#### ****Business Task****
Analyze the pattern and differences between casual riders and members, to provide insights on converting casual riders into members.
